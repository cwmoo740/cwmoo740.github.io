As more people and more money moved onto the internet, developers and marketers realized that being the top of google searches was critical to making money. Some simply purchased ads or added relevant keywords to optimize SEO, but people are increasingly taking on an adversarial role with google.

There are already politicians around the world calling for intervention in Google and accusing them of bias.
