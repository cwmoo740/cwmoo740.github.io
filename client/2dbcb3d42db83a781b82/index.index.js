var code = "<section> <h3>Failures Addressing the Pandemic</h3> <p> It's still early in the covid19 epidemic sweeping the world, but the US appears to have failed in its response. \"The system was blinking red\" according to an anonymous source in the federal government speaking to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html\"> Washington Post </a>, in a clear allusion to the 9/11 commission report on intelligence failures leading up to that terrorist attack. <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/25/coronavirus-worst-intelligence-failure-us-history-covid-19/\"> Foreign Policy </a> follows up by asserting that this was a bigger intelligence failure than 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, primarily because the evidence of danger was so clear, but still ignored. </p> <p> The US also had a clear playbook to follow, one that other countries have followed to the letter. Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Singapore all implemented testing, quarantines, contact tracing, and public information campaigns. There is a high degree of compliance among citizens, and almost everyone appears to be wearing masks and gloves and rigorously disinfecting public spaces and checking the public for fevers. Taiwan, despite hundreds of thousands of people traveling back and forth to China, has kept the confirmed case count to only 252 as of March 26th. The US had a similar playbook handed down to the current administration, but high turnover and a culture of fear among subordinates and health experts led to the problem being ignored until it blew up out of control. </p> <p> There is another reason that the US failed the initial response to SARS-COV-2: the virus is invisible at first. Potentially half of carriers have mild or no symptoms, and there's a lengthy incubation period and early flu-like symptoms before it develops into life-threatening pneumonia. Taken together, it means that exponential growth can progress silently for weeks before the unfolding public health crisis becomes apparent. There is no hope of containing this virus without an extremely aggressive public health campaign. This means testing hundreds of thousands of people, maintaining a public health bureaucracy to track cases and enforce quarantine, and a huge public outreach and education campaign. This is not possible without political will. </p> <p> The US, to put it mildly, has not done this. The country was already coming apart at the seams, burning in the flames of an interminable culture war stoked by political consultants for electoral gain. In this environment, one side believed it was advantageous to dismiss the virus as a hoax designed to hurt the president and the American economy. The consequences are now unfolding daily, but it's still unclear if the political factions in the US will sign an armistice, or if political polarization will prevail. </p> </section> <section> <h3>Climate Change</h3> <p> The parallels with climate change are obvious. Climate change is an invisible, slow-moving threat, until some undefined time in the future when it will blow up in our faces. The world is beginning to regularly observe the effects of climate change, but its manifestation is unequal and confusing, making it easy to dismiss as natural variation. The United States can put off any response by assuring ourselves that China will never buy in, and any unilateral action will unfairly burden our economy. The clear and present danger is even murkier than SARS-COV-2, requiring non-experts to make an epistemological argument about which media outlets and scientific organizations to trust. There is an even more concentrated financial interest on the side of doing nothing about climate change. These financial interests have successfully made climate change another front in the culture war, making the issue too politically toxic for most mainstream politicians to touch. </p> <p> The prognosis is not good. Just as with COVID-19, the playbook is clear, but not easy. So far, the lackluster response to the virus looks eerily similar to the lackluster response to climate change. Blame other countries, deny the problem exists, claim the cure is worse than the disease, and turn a scientific argument into an epistemological one, all to delay any meaningful action for political gain. </p> <p> It is up to voters to decide if this is an acceptable reality. One benefit of having an immediate problem like a viral pandemic is to remind America that we can still engage in large collective action if the political will is there. Most of America is currently on lockdown, and the US government finally agreed on a massive $2 trillion stimulus package. A similar sense of urgency could be brought to bear on climate change now that American voters realize this kind of government action is possible and can improve their lives. It is up to all Americans to demand competence and rationality from the government, and this pandemic may be the best wake up call possible. </p> </section> ";

var code = "<section> <p> Google's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/\">original mission</a> was to \"organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\". Google redefined how the internet works, so much so that few people remember what the internet was like before google. The early internet consisted of collections of home pages like yahoo that aggregated links; all content was curated because there was no other way to discover it. </p> <p> Google fundamentally changed how we search for information by indexing and ranking everything. Their initial algorithm was simple, but their early success fueled the utopian ideal of allowing everyone in the world to access all the information they wanted. Google was a fantastic way to search the early internet, which was full of random individual pages, useful blogs, academic articles, and weird memes. Google even attempted to get the world's offline information to be searchable, scanning and uploading books and scholarly articles in either a quixotic quest to democratize information or a way to break into the book publishing and selling business, depending on the point of view. </p> <p> Something has changed, however. As more people and more money moved onto the internet, developers and marketers realized that being the top of google searches was critical to making money. Some simply purchased ads or added relevant keywords to optimize SEO, but people are increasingly taking on an adversarial role with google. One current strategy is to lock meaningful content behind paywalls or account signups ala Quora, but the other top strategy is to flood google with low quality or misleading information to muddy the waters. </p> <p> This isn't fundamentally different to the pre-internet days. Muddying the waters has been used to great success in the 20th century, and likely before then too. There's an entire satire about its success in America: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_You_for_Smoking\">Thank You For Smoking</a>. What is new is the velocity and scale that it can take on today, and the financial incentives that make it so profitable. </p> <p> To pick on the mattress industry, google has been flooded with fake paid reviews, blogs covered in referral links, and other low quality content. Technically the FTC requires that paid posts show a disclosure, but they're often elusive or missing. It requires <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3065928/sleepopolis-casper-bloggers-lawsuits-underside-of-the-mattress-wars\"> an investigative journalist </a> to decipher the web of sponsored content and misleading information. Thankfully mattresses aren't lethal like cigarettes, so real world harm is limited. Anyone searching for a mattress, however, quickly gets sucked into the vortex of fake reviews and sponsored content. This has led to the rise of review sites like <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/\">Wirecutter</a> just to wade through the mountains of bullshit. But as sleepopolis shows, even the review sites are subject to capture by the marketing industrial spam complex. </p> </section> <section> <p> There are other far more nefarious uses for this strategy too. \"Fake News\" was the talk of the 2016 US Election, and it shows no signs of abating anytime soon. There are a variety of reasons that fake news is so successful, but it's also telling that running a fake news site can <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo\"> make money. </a> It may have started as a method of trolling and earning advertising revenue, but it looks to be increasingly institutionalized as organizations realize how successful it is. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/20/britains-conservatives-accused-misleading-public-with-fake-fact-checking-account-election-looms/\"> fake fact checking account </a> in the UK. In other alarming news, fake news made a prominent display in the Donald Trump impeachment hearings when Devin Nunes harassed a witness about <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2019/11/23/republican-impeachment-strategy-rests-part-conspiracy-theories/qIQ9pzRbCtoX59vC319CeP/story.html\"> fake news conspiracies. </a> That should have rung alarm bells everywhere - a US congressman bringing up 4chan style allegations about Ukraine during what was otherwise a serious proceeding. It was yet another sign that online clickbait had crossed over and taken up residence in official halls of power. </p> <p> This doesn't even get into the problems that will come when machine learning content takes off. The potential to generate millions of pages of fake news articles, fake videos, fake audio recordings, fake transcripts, is going to present a huge problem for political discourse. </p> </section> <section> <p> All of this spells trouble for Google. Despite their forays into different products and businesses, their search business is the cash cow of the company. The increasing prevalance of fake news, misleading marketing, low quality spam, and misinformation puts Google in an unenviable position. Instead of just presenting what's on the internet, they're going to have to take an increasingly editorial role, and that's a risky position to be in. There are already politicians around the world calling for intervention in Google and accusing them of bias. Even if Google is extremely careful in what it shows and hides, there is no winning this game. So far Google's strategy (at least in the US) seems to be to prioritize established media companies to the point of drowning out everything else. </p> <ol> <li> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-socialmedia-idUSKCN1RM2SJ\"> Facebook, Google accused of anti-conservative bias at U.S. Senate hearing </a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/brexit-news-latest-google-bias-remain-leave-eu-a9169636.html\"> Google dismisses Brexiteer claims it favours pro-Remain news outlets, saying 'quality and relevance' dictate results </a> </li> </ol> <p> It's a similar story on the commercial front, even though that has gotten far less popular attention and fewer hand-wringing editorials. There are too many interested parties trying to promote their latest scams or junk. Google maps has already been <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/02/exploiting_goog.html\"> overwhelmed by tens of thousands of fake businesses </a> that are out to steal your money. And here's the tricky part: Google makes <em>a lot of money</em> from all these scams, just like they do from legitimate businesses. </p> <p> So what does this mean for Google? Most likely continued commercial success, but increasingly dissatisfied users. They will be attacked alternatively for being overly paternalistic in protecting users from junk, and as dangerous for exposing users to misleading information. Google being Google, they will spend increasing amounts of engineering effort attempting to combat the problems with code, only to get burned in dramatic fashion. </p> </section> ";

var code = "<section> <p> I watched <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/his-dark-materials\">His Dark Materials</a> over the 2019 holidays. This is not a review, but just some thoughts I had about the series as I was watching it. It may contain spoilers, but it's not the intention to reveal any of the important plot details. </p> <p> Lyra, the young protagonist, lives in a world of imposing men in dark suits, striding menacingly through a vast concrete labyrinth that suggests power and tradition. They are the Magisterium. They represent the ruling class, the powerful political and religious elites, who decide the fate of the world. They maintain strict control over knowledge, and have a strained détente with institutions of higher learning. Citizens are indoctrinated into a fascist quasi-religious state, enforced by a threatening army of jack-booted soldiers. </p> <p> It is unclear what the Magisterium actually wants other than power, but it's unimportant what their actual motivations are. They're meant to stand in for any organization that claims to hold exclusive access to truth and morality, but enforces this truth with the threat of violence. The author of the book trilogy is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Pullman#Perspective_on_religion\">prominent atheist</a> and was writing about the Catholic church, but he also says that an atheist totalitarian regime could be similarly criticized. </p> <p> All of this comes under threat because of Lyra. An inquisitive child and eager learner, she quickly comes into possession of a magical truth-telling device called an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_(His_Dark_Materials)#Alethiometers\">alethiometer</a>. These are said to require years of study to properly interpret, but Lyra can use it intuitively. It works via a mysterious fundamental particle named Dust, which surrounds and permeates adults, but not children. The Magisterium forbid any mention of Dust, but Lyra refuses to let the topic go and goes off on a grand adventure to find out the truth, aided by her (illegal and highly coveted) alethiometer. </p> <div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:center\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"/images/alethiometer.png\" alt=\"alethiometer\"> </div> </section> <section> <p> Now that the backstory is out of the way, we can dig into the meaning. In the real world, there is no such thing as absolute truth, only shades of grey. It's impossible to know in the moment if a decision is going to be correct or moral in the future, and we ordinary humans must muddle through blindly and hope that we're trending towards good. Noble goals are corrupted, and silver linings are pulled out of terrible situations, often despite the best efforts of people involved. </p> <p> In contrast, Philip Pullman cleverly inserts absolute truth into the book's world by creating the alethiometer. It is impossible to doubt the existence of some all knowing force because this device is functional proof of omniscience. It's easy to see why this is threatening to the Magisterium: they claim to hold the keys to all knowledge and truth, but the alethiometer has no allegiance to their power. It tells the absolute truth to anyone that knows how to read it, inconvenience to the ruling class be damned. </p> <p> It's also telling that the alethiometer normally requires years of study to discern truth, but the child protagonist can use it by feel. Adults arrive at morality through study and reflection, whereas a child's perspective is brash and unfiltered. Adults may be better at reasoning about complex moral issues, but reason also lays traps for the intellectually and morally lazy. Adults learn to use reason to justify immoral behavior with convoluted explanations that often conveniently line up with their own self interest. In some cases, it is useful to adopt a child's eyes and address your gut feelings on a topic, rather than bringing an intellectual argument to bear. </p> <p> Adults also use words to obscure and confuse, whereas children do not yet have the vocabulary or skill necessary to dissemble so effectively. Adults will use complex terms like \"Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligations\" and \"Enhanced Interrogation Techniques\" to cover up their true meaning and intentions, in the hope that listeners will gloss over these important sounding terms and take the speaker at face value. Any idea worth explaining and defending can and should be relentlessly simplified until a sufficiently interested layperson, or even a child, can understand it. Only when an idea can be explained and understood can it be morally evaluated. </p> </section> <section> <p> If you had an alethiometer, what would you ask it? If you could have a child's moral perspective again, what would you see? You probably have an issue in mind already, and most likely, you don't need the alethiometer to tell you the answer. It's easy to rationalize and explain away the details about why something isn't so bad, but if you reduce it to its simplest parts and look at it like a child, the answer is often staring you in the face. I think I know what question Philip Pullman wanted answered, and it was about morality and the Catholic church, but his novel generalizes to a tale about unassailable moral righteousness against existing power structures. </p> <p> In 2020 America, the most obvious radical wrong is healthcare. Try to explain the healthcare system to a child whose parent is sick. Ask your internal alethiometer if healthcare is working for the people paying more and more while health outcomes stall and doctors work longer hours in more difficult conditions. The insurance company executives and hospital administrators are akin to the imposing men in dark suits striding menacingly through the halls of power, attempting to convince you that they alone have the answer to running an enormous health care system, an answer that mysteriously aligns with their own financial self interest. They invent terms like copay, coinsurance, deductible, out of pocket max, out of network, HMO, PPO, EPO, PBM, mostly to confuse and convince people that it's VERY COMPLICATED and best left to the insurance executives. They alone can determine what is medically necessary or not, what and who to cover or not, which prescription drugs are acceptable or not, and none of this can be explained to any mere mortal outside of the industry. </p> <p> I'm not sure what the solution is to go from where we are now to where we need to be, because path-dependent systems are complicated and difficult to tinker with. But the next time someone talks about how healthcare is very complicated and we shouldn't change it because the insurance companies know what they're doing and are too powerful, remind them that there is no moral way to justify what is happening today. Try justifying modern healthcare to a child, or your internal alethiometer, and see how you feel about it without the jargon and political baggage. The answer is staring you in the face. </p> </section> ";

var code = "<section> <p> Modern American conservatives have successfully campaigned on law and order since at least George Wallace in 1968. The appeal to law and order is universal and timeless, and is currently seeing a resurgence in countries as diverse as the US, Philippines, Turkey, and Hungary. In times of uncertainty, inequality, and increasing pessimism for the prospects of our children, people worldwide turn to the promise of stability, order, and a tinge of nostalgia for simpler times. The US in particular is leading the way, as Trump is stirring up chaos by shouting \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN\" while simultaneously campaigning on being a bulwark against rampant lawlessness if Biden takes office. </p> <p> Republicans have effectively captured the Law and Order message and vote. Republicans were so successful in the wake of urban decay in America in the 1970s that the Democratic party was forced to meet Republicans on their chosen field of battle. Democratic politicians like Bill Clinton were falling over themselves proving how tough on crime they were by passing mandatory minimums, massive expansions of police forces, construction of more prisons, and turning a blind eye to existing police abuses. By playing on Republican ground, Democrats were successful in implementing Republican priorities, but without getting much political credit in return. If crime was reduced, it was seen as a vindication of the Republican agenda; if crime increased, it was seen as proof that Democrats had not gone far enough and that the Republicans would. </p> <p> The Democratic leadership of today were still in power in the 1990s. Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Tom Perez, and a host of other Democratic insiders remember the 90s as a time of fantastic Democratic success via triangulation. By playing towards the center and accepting the Republican party's chosen playing fields, they could sway the moderate flank of Republicans, but still have the votes of more progressive Democrats because those voters had nowhere else to go. Fast forward to 2020, and it puts Joe Biden in the peculiar position of renouncing a signature legislative accomplishment of his own party, the 1994 crime bill, to court Millenials and Zoomers for whom Bill Clinton is a vague childhood memory. Meanwhile the rest of the party has failed to adapt as Boomers hold onto political power for decades beyond their normal tenure because of the success. It also puts the Democratic party in the uncomfortable position of defending from Republican accusations that Democrats are now backing rioting and looting. Democrats have not come up with any convincing message on resolving the seeming paradox between crime and racial progress. The best example of this is trying to explain what \"Defund the Police\" means, which they don't agree on themselves. </p> </section> <section> <p> It's time to abandon the Republicans' field of battle and to change the rules. The apparent paradox between racial progress and being tough on crime is just a mirage put there by Republicans because they have been allowed to dominate the conversation on crime and policing, with the help of the Democrats, for the past 50 years. Millenials are now the largest generation, and the sway of tough on crime propaganda has less effect on them, but the aging Democratic leadership refuses to adapt. It's time to change the narrative. There are a couple of avenues of attack. </p> <p> Republicans cannot be allowed to be the party of Law and Order when their party is rife with corruption. A simplified comparison of <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/9/18/1796668/-UPDATED-Comparing-Presidential-Administrations-by-felony-arrests-and-convictions-as-of-9-17-2018\"> indictments across Republican and Democratic administrations </a> should be plastered on every campaign mailer in Republican controlled districts with the tagline, \"What crime is your Congressional representative committing? Vote Democrat.\" Is it Law and Order when Republicans violate the law for political goals, like the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/06/899712823/new-york-attorney-general-moves-to-dissolve-the-nra-after-fraud-investigation\"> fraud spiraling out of control </a> at the NRA for the past decade? Or what about a presidential administration <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_(2001%E2%80%932007)\"> spying on the American people </a>, running <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/13/the-black-sites\">torture camps</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_CIA_interrogation_videotapes_destruction\">destroying evidence</a>, and allowing a man who could possibly the largest individual tax cheat in American history to become President. There is no excuse for not personally going after every individual Republican that took money from the NRA during their period of laundering foreign cash and stealing from their own members. All corners of the Democratic party should go on television with a unified message that Republicans are the party of criminals. </p> <p> Push back on the police, but not in the way that progressive activists are doing. Support police reform, but do not do it on the terms of engagement that Republicans have laid down in the public consciousness. Do not endorse defunding the police, because that slogan is a political minefield. The Democratic party must cast itself as the ally of honest, hardworking police officers, many of whom are themselves concerned about the lawlessness within police ranks. Make emotional pleas to police officers nationwide: \"We know that you are an honest, hardworking cop. It's a small minority of police that are out of control, and the Democrats can help you take back your police department.\" Because it is true that many police agencies are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/\"> out of control </a>, having jumped at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/us/texas-officers-accused-of-helping-drug-smugglers.html\"> easy cash </a> offered by <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/10/06/corrupt-chicago-police-were-taxing-drug-dealers-and-targeting-their-rivals/\"> drug money </a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Five\">gang protection</a>. It is also true that there are a slew of police officers standing up to testify against the abuses their colleagues commit, but they are routinely <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/13/876628281/what-happens-when-officers-blow-the-whistle-on-police-misconduct\"> pushed out of their departments </a> or even <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-baltimore-detective-update-20171122-story.html\"> murdered </a> if they refuse to uphold the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wall_of_silence\">Blue Wall of Silence</a>. Democrats must capitalize on this. Police are a powerful political force with broad support, especially among Republicans, and it would be lethal to the Republican party if Democrats were seen as the pro police party. Link Republican policies of racial discrimination, personal corruption, and lack of respect for the law to the culture of lawlessness that exists within some police units. Obama's administration successfully implemented police reforms via consent decrees in many cities, and those projects have been massive successes. But in typical Obama style, he refused to take political credit for reforming police departments in a way that's advantageous to both police and citizens, and refused to hit the Republican party where it hurts by attacking them for their lack of ability to clean up police departments. </p> <p> Another future strategy must be to link the Republican brand with looting. Someone dressed in all black smashing Foot Locker windows to grab Nikes is a scary image, but the reality is that they're insignificant compared to the scale of looting that has taken place in the United States in the past 20 years. Trump has overseen trillions of dollars of emergency coronavirus relief spending after <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-stimulus/trump-administration-is-blocking-covid-stimulus-oversight-government-watchdog-letter-idUSKBN23M2XD\"> destroying normal oversight </a> to award <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/addressing-the-other-covid-crisis-corruption/\">massive windfalls</a> to his supporters. His administration <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-07/hospitals-washington-seize-coronavirus-supplies\"> looted essential PPE </a> during a pandemic and then awarded <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/white-house-pandemic-supply-project-swathed-in-secrecy-and-exaggerations/2020/05/08/9c77efb2-8d52-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html\"> special contracts </a> to friendly medical supply companies that subsidized their procurement of PPE but allowed them to charge open market prices in an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-trump-sowed-covid-supply-chaos-try-getting-it-yourselves-11598893051\"> escalating bidding war between states </a>. This is not capitalism, but open looting of the public good. Looting is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/30/state-department-wouldnt-reveal-its-payments-mar-a-lago-heres-how-we-found-them/\"> charging the State Department $3 for water </a> when Trump insisted on relocating meetings with Shinzo Abe to Mar-a-Lago. Republicans fabricate horrendous talking points like the birther conspiracy or \"death panels\" and stick on message forever, but Democrats can't manage a proper media blitz even when it's truthful. </p> </section> <section> <p> Democrats need to reaffirm the message that there can be no law and order without justice. Order is meaningless when the order being protected allows children to be caged, civilians to be tortured, and American taxpayers to be fleeced by the president's son-in-law. Calls for law and order are a hollow mockery when the existing order is morally bankrupt, yet Republicans continue to monopolize the message and win powerful endorsements from police unions. Kamala Harris is even a successful prosecutor, but I imagine Democratic focus groups told them to soften her image because too many voters will reject a woman that appears too combative. Still, in the meantime Democrats are missing out on populist anger lingering from the Iraq War, the financial crisis, and now the Trump presidency. </p> <p> The next generation of Democratic politicians have been better at managing media and going on the offense. AOC and Buttigieg both do a great job here in many respects, but even they stay away from the messages of law and order. In the remote chance that either they or their staff ever read this, I leave with a closing request: take a listen to the voters in this episode of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/podcasts/the-daily/political-violence-washington-north-carolina.html\"> NYT's The Field </a>. These are regular people that have fallen for the Republican propaganda on law and order, and think hard about to get them back on side. </p> </section> ";

var code = "<section> <p> The numbers, Judy! Tell me the numbers today! The numbers tell me everything I need to know about how the day will go. Are they up, are they down, are they better, are they worse. I need to know how the numbers are doing or my day is incomplete. What would happen to me if I didn't know the numbers that day? What if the numbers catch me unaware, and sneak up on me from behind? I have to be prepared for whatever the numbers say, not so that I can change my behavior, but so that I can have a correctly calibrated sense of alarm as I sit at home. </p> <p> There are so many numbers now that dictate life or death. Daily case and death counts. Total hospitalizations. IFR, CFR, R0, test positivity rate, false positive and false negative rates. Seeing bad numbers can set my mind racing, making it difficult to think about anything except THE NUMBERS. My life has always been dominated by numbers, the more normal numbers of GPA, FIDE rating, BTC, $SPY, horsepower, EBITDA, conversion rate, training accuracy, p-values, and the like. I have always been a numerate person. I breezed through math courses until hitting upper division Partial Differential Equations. But lately the overflow of numbers has taken on something of a surreal quality. </p> <p> The rapid fire pace of new developments, and the divergence between my overwhelmingly boring personal daily lived experience and what I intellectually know to be happening out in the world, has caused a rift between what I know is true and how prepared I am to face it. The daily uncertainty of not knowing the answer to if my parents or friends are going to get sick is wearing on me, despite the fact that I can easily estimate their risk based on their general health, age, demographics, and adherence to general safety precautions. This feeling of the normal rules being suspended and life no longer being real is all too familiar to me. </p> </section> <section> <p> I have felt derealization before. Extended periods of isolation or uncertainty can bring a strange sensation that the world is behind glass. I reach out my hand trying to grab onto something real, but come up with the empty idea that the world has frozen in time, unalterable and alien and timeless, while I am trapped outside it. One of my most acute memories of temporary derealization may be one familiar to New Yorkers: the drunken 2am subway ride home. The late night trains take what seems like forever to arrive while a bizarre parade of confusing and occasionally threatening subway creatures pass by. While waiting in the oppressive heat and dark of the broken down and dirty tunnel, it's easy to lose all sense of time and perspective. I come to the realization that I am no longer an individual with free will, but an automaton that has always and will always be trapped in subway purgatory, waiting for a train that will never arrive as sweat drips down the back of my neck. There is no self, just the all enveloping wait for <i>something</i> to happen. </p> <p> The covid 19 lockdown has been ongoing for endless months of waiting and watching, just like the subway. I keep looking at the numbers, because they are a link to an objective reality that exists outside of my small internal world. The numbers dictate when life can resume, when I can see my family again, and when I can think about life plans again. But while I know they are real, they also are very much not real; they are the shadows on a cave wall that represent one singular view of the lives of billions of people and millions of grieving families. But there is also the feeling that they are completely out of the control of any human. The numbers, the deaths, the suffering, are the work of implacable laws of nature like logistic curves and the buoyancy of viral particles as a function of relative humidity and temperature. </p> <p> The vaccines are coming, just like the subway will arrive sometime. But knowing that the subway is arriving in 14 minutes is almost meaningless when time itself is interminable. Borrowing from the words of the excellent writer <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/12/next-six-months-will-be-vaccine-purgatory/617371/\"> Sarah Zhang </a>, we are now in vaccine purgatory. The end is in sight, but there is enough uncertainty to make it feel illusory and impossible. The distribution rules are confusing and uncertain. There is an untenable amount of faith and hope required that an administration that has failed in such a complete and unbelievable fashion will now perform one of the largest and most accelerated logistics and public relations problems in human history. The first subway trip I took in NYC as an adult was figuratively derailed by a trash fire during a record summer heat wave, and while there are reasons to believe that the rest of the pandemic will not play out this way, the figurative trash fire could strike at any moment. </p> </section> <section> <p> I know from experience that derealization is a coping mechanism to deal with emotional overload. When something is too threatening or painful to face head on, derealization and avoidance temporarily insulates the psyche from the full ramifications of the tragedy. I will continue to keep track of the numbers, but I am also aware that the tragedy is unfolding faster than I can emotionally absorb it. After reading about the suffering of ICU nurses that are witnessing a flood of death, and the tens of millions of Americans that face an uncertain economic future and agonize daily about whether they'll be able to feed their kids this month, it is impossible to separate the numbers from the suffering that they cause. I recognize that I am emotionally affected by the suffering of others to the degree that it's affecting my own mental state while keeping track of this pandemic. </p> <p> I also know that someday soon, I will look back on this time and come to terms with the anxiety and uncertainty and come out ok. I have the personal tools and knowledge to do this for myself as an individual. My hope now is that there will also be a collective, rather than individual, accounting of the pain caused by this pandemic and our collective failure to address it. We will need it in order for us to all heal. </p> </section> ";
